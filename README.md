# -Recycled-Linux-Workstation-Build
DIY Linux workstation using salvaged components, running Parrot OS

This is a personal project where I built a functional Linux workstation from old and recycled PC parts, contributed by family and friends. It's now running Parrot OS and will be used to learn more about Linux, security, and SOC analysis.
