## 🎯 Project Goals

- ✅ Build a working PC from recycled parts  
- ✅ Install and configure Parrot OS  
- ⏳ Set up a home cybersecurity lab  
- ⏳ Practice Linux CLI and bash scripting  
- ⏳ Explore SOC tools, log analysis, and monitoring

## 💡 Notes

Despite using old hardware, the system runs well enough for Linux and security tool experimentation. This is a low-risk environment for learning, breaking things, and rebuilding.

## 📸 Screenshots
A little bit of a mess because the components don't really match the PC case but i made it work (while trying to keep the PS with enough ventilation):

This is the best (free) RAM i could find - sadly:

Lastly, i had too options for the HDD and decided to go for 1tb (the seagate one) because i don't trust the PS to be strong enough:
